# ConnectFour

A virtual implementation of the classic Connect Four game, implemented in Python. The game allows two players to play against each other on the same computer. The goal of the game is to be the first to get four of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the other player does.

<h2>Game Rules</h2>

1. The game is played on a 7x6 board.

2. Players take turns dropping their symbol (X or O) into one of the seven columns.

3. The first player to get four of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.

4. If the board is filled and no one has won, the game is a tie.
